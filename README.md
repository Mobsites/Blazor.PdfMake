## Design and Development

The design and development of this Blazor component was heavily guided by Microsoft's [Steve Sanderson](https://blog.stevensanderson.com/). He outlines a superb approach to building and deploying a reusable component library in this [presentation](https://youtu.be/QnBYmTpugz0) and [example](https://github.com/SteveSandersonMS/presentation-2020-01-NdcBlazorComponentLibraries).
